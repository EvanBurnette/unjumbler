# Unjumbler

## What is this?

This program helps you solve (and therefore ruins the fun of) the popular newspaper word game Jumble™️

## Why?

It reminded me of a coding challenge and I wanted to do something that could use multiple cores of the CPU back in Winter of 2021. I've resurrected the project here with a GUI as a practice portfolio project before I integrate the following technologies into a bigger portfolio project: SampleKiller.com.

## Technologies integrated in this little app

1. Vite
1. Typescript
1. Svelte & Sveltekit
1. Skeleton UI & Tailwind CSS
1. WebWorkers & comlink
